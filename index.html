                    <p class="text_paragraph">I built this website from scratch to strengthen my html and css skills and to host my GIS portfolio. Feel free to navigate through the pages to see my portfolio, my resume, and my contact info if you'd like to get in touch. As I learn more about JavaScript libraries such as JQuery and React I also hope to add some interactive features to this site. But now, a little about myself.</p>
                    <p class="text_paragraph">I graduated from Temple University May 2017 with a B.A. in Environmental Studies. Additionally, I've completed a certificate in GIS which required an introductory course, a spatial statistics course, and then two electives. Instead of doing two electives I've completed or am in the process of completing six. The GIS electives I've completed are: Urban GIS, Remote Sensing and GIS, Spatial Database Design, and Environmental GIS. I've also taken GIS for Application Development in which Python is used and Web Mapping and GIS in which the JavaScript library Leaflet is used.</p>
                    <p class="text_paragraph">In addition to my coursework I've completed two GIS internships. My first GIS internship was with the Philadelphia Parks Alliance and my second was with the City of Philadelphia's Office of Innovation and Technology. Currently I work for Metro Commercial Real Estate as a GIS Analyst</p>
